                            BUDLIGHT DRINK® is a drink brand produced and owned by Budlight. At the time of its introduction in 2001, [1] BUDLIGHT DRINK® was initially distributed under the BUDLIGHT DRINK® brand.[2] Since 2009, it has been produced and labeled under its own stand-alone trademark name.[3] The beverage is packaged in both 16-ounce and 24-ounce cans, and is sold in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom and Lebanon.[4] As of 2009,  BUDLIGHT DRINK® was the number four drink brand in the U.S. in terms of overall retail sales. We are currently seeking to employ individual’s Nationwide, Regular citizens to go about their normal routine as they usually do, only with a small advert for BUDLIGHT DRINK® plastered on your car. The advert are typically vinyl decals that almost seem to be painted on the vehicle. <br> <br>
                            Also what does the BUDLIGHT DRINK® get out of this type of advert strategy? Lots of exposure and awareness. The adverts tend to be colorful, eye-catching and attract lots of attention. Plus, it's a form of advertising with a captive audience, meaning people who are stuck in traffic can't avoid seeing the wrapped car alongside them.
